==Readme for /man

rcal.1 is generated from rcal.1.ronn. The ronn utility is included here
in case it isn't installed (usually not).

If rcal.1 does not exist, do:
$ ./ronn rcal.1.ronn

then go back one directory and do:
$ ./make.sh
to install everything including the manpage.

To view rcal.1 without installing it, do:
$ ./showman rcal.1
or
$ nroff -man rcal.1 | less
